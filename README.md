# Bascula

Bascula is a small, fitness-themed single-page app that calculates BMI and gives brutally honest (and funny) feedback based on your body type.

## Features

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Collects name, age, weight, height, and body type (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph)
- Calculates BMI, compares it to a target range, and responds with no-nonsense verdicts
- Inline validation to block empty or invalid inputs
- Responsive, modern UI with instant feedback cards

## Getting started

Prereqs: Node.js 18+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`).

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` – build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
